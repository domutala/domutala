👋🏾 **Hello, I'm Mamadou!**
---

A passionate, curious, and detail-oriented developer, I love designing elegant and high-performing solutions, where every line of code reflects **clarity** and **quality**.

After several years as an employee working on various projects, I founded **[@Advensya](https://github.com/advensya)** and launched **[Tarico](https://www.tarico.com)**, an HR and administrative SaaS platform specifically designed for the **African market**.

I support ambitious projects and share my vision for **modern development**.
