👋🏾 Hi, I’m Mamadou!
---

I’m a passionate, curious, and detail-oriented developer who loves designing elegant and high-performance solutions, where every line of code reflects clarity and quality.
After several years working on diverse projects as an employee, I founded [@Advensya](https://github.com/advensya) and launched **[Tarico](https://www.tarico.com)**, a SaaS HR and administrative platform specifically designed for small and medium-sized African businesses.
I support ambitious projects and share my vision of modern software development.
